Everyone makes guacamole. I'm going to show you the way I make mine. And I happen to have small, those are tiny avocado. This is what my market had today. So you going around, you bang the thing and you move it to remove this. But of course you want them ripe for that. So sometime at the market, you know, you have to wait. Okay. What I do with the avocado like this, I cut it in half or in 3 piece here, couple of pieces there. And that's how usually, if I do a salad, I do this. I just have to empty it in there. Now it's all cut. Now 1 thing that someone showed me, if you wash that in cold water, That prevent it from getting discolored. It doesn't matter in that because we're gonna season it with lemon juice and so forth. But if you wanna do a salad and you wanna keep it for a while before it discolor, wash it in cold water like this. So for that, I don't really have to cut it. I will empty it here. And yeah, I have about close to a pound of avocado here. So the avocado here, I think 1 of the best way is to just crush it like this. I don't like it when it's too much of a puree. And then your seasoning in there. I have about 3 quarter of a cup of a tomato. I would say that the onion, preferably mild onion for what I have here. At the most you like a quarter of a cup. I have jalapeno pepper here and I'm going to cut the inside, remember this is the rib. The rib inside, as well as the seed. This is really what's the strongest. And I would also always tell you that when you get those pepper, taste them, because sometimes... Have a little piece of pepper. This 1 is pretty mild, doesn't have much taste. So again, you know, that play with you, you put more, you put less depending. Okay. Here I'm going to put the whole jalapeno because as I said, doesn't have much taste. And of course some cilantro there. Coarsely chopped and I would say 12A good 2 tablespoons. And this I want to use probably, removing the seed here, I would say a good tablespoon, tablespoon and a half maybe, of lemon juice, it's up to you. And I would say a good, well, 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Then with that, salt, a quarter of a teaspoon of salt. You can always taste it. That's it. That's it. And more salt. Like to put it into a nice bowl like this. All kinds of variation on that, less pepper, more pepper, no olive oil, garlic. It's a question of taste. You know, you adjust and sometimes you do it 1 way, sometimes you do it another way. That's a great order I used to do, certainly, when I spent time in Mexico. My guacamole, and this, of course, with blue corn tortilla, regular corn chip and so forth. Enjoy and happy cooking. \u266a\u266a\u266a you", "confidence": 0.81784415, "words": [{"word": "hi", "start": 0.29999998, "end": 0.79999995, "confidence": 0.99231344, "punctuated_word": "Hi,"},

Everyone makes guacamole. I'm going to show you the way I make mine. And I happen to have small, those are tiny avocado. This is what my market had today.\n\nSo you going around, you bang the thing and you move it to remove this. But of course you want them ripe for that. So sometime at the market, you know, you have to wait. Okay. What I do with the avocado like this, I cut it in half or in 3 piece here, couple of pieces there.\n\nAnd that's how usually, if I do a salad, I do this. I just have to empty it in there. Now it's all cut. Now 1 thing that someone showed me, if you wash that in cold water, That prevent it from getting discolored. It doesn't matter in that because we're gonna season it with lemon juice and so forth.\n\nBut if you wanna do a salad and you wanna keep it for a while before it discolor, wash it in cold water like this. So for that, I don't really have to cut it. I will empty it here. And yeah, I have about close to a pound of avocado here. So the avocado here, I think 1 of the best way is to just crush it like this.\n\nI don't like it when it's too much of a puree. And then your seasoning in there. I have about 3 quarter of a cup of a tomato. I would say that the onion, preferably mild onion for what I have here. At the most you like a quarter of a cup.\n\nI have jalapeno pepper here and I'm going to cut the inside, remember this is the rib. The rib inside, as well as the seed. This is really what's the strongest. And I would also always tell you that when you get those pepper, taste them, because sometimes... Have a little piece of pepper.\n\nThis 1 is pretty mild, doesn't have much taste. So again, you know, that play with you, you put more, you put less depending. Okay. Here I'm going to put the whole jalapeno because as I said, doesn't have much taste. And of course some cilantro there.\n\nCoarsely chopped and I would say 12A good 2 tablespoons. And this I want to use probably, removing the seed here, I would say a good tablespoon, tablespoon and a half maybe, of lemon juice, it's up to you. And I would say a good, well, 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Then with that, salt, a quarter of a teaspoon of salt. You can always taste it.\n\nThat's it. That's it. And more salt. Like to put it into a nice bowl like this. All kinds of variation on that, less pepper, more pepper, no olive oil, garlic.\n\nIt's a question of taste. You know, you adjust and sometimes you do it 1 way, sometimes you do it another way. That's a great order I used to do, certainly, when I spent time in Mexico. My guacamole, and this, of course, with blue corn tortilla, regular corn chip and so forth. Enjoy and happy cooking.\n\n\u266a\u266a\u266a you", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home.", "start": 0.29999998, "end": 3.6999998}, {"text":

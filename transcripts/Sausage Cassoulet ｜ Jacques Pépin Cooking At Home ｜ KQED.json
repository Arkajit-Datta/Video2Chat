There is a famous dish in the southwest of France called cassoulet. You cook beans usually, there is duck in it, all kinds of sausage in it. It's a very famous dish, which now I'm going to do a kind of bastardized version of it, very easy to do. And I'll start by putting a little bit of olive oil in there and I have 3 sausage here that I find in my freezer. This is an Italian type sausage, which is raw meat. So I'm gonna cut that into pieces like this. Okay, because this has to cook. I'm gonna put that to cook directly in there. Okay. And then I have 2 other sausage here. This is a type of a bratwurst or kielbasa. Bit of the same idea. Those are cooked sausage. So they can go later. And this is, as you can see, a hot dog. So that's good too. All right. I am going to put an onion. And this, of course, we can do it ahead. You can do it, of course, with dry beans, but it makes it very easy to do it a few minutes here. Like this, and the garlic, you know, Just coarsely chopped and cooked in there. All right. Just cook that 2, 3 minutes. So maybe I could add this to it. I'm gonna saute that for a minute. And what I have here, I have a can of, well, cannellini beans or butter beans or white, tiny white beans. Anyway, even the red beans too, it's a question of choice what you have in your refrigerator. And to cook this, what I'm going to do is to pour the water that I have in there. Yeah. And I'm going to cook for a few minutes, for a couple of minutes with that water. Actually, I could even cover that 2, 3 minute. And during that time, I can do my garnish here for the hands. So As you see, I have a little piece of tomato, probably third of a cup or so. Bit of garlic, again. Can never be enough garlic for me. So I chop that. And if I were to do that ahead, I would do what I did there. And after I'm going to add the other sausage in it too, but I would not add what I have here, which is parsley, the tomato and the garlic. I would add that only when I'm serving it. Just to bring it to a boil and serve it, but that you could do that a few hours ahead. Yeah, that's fine. I can see this has cooked. Yeah, the onion is about cooked. So let's put the rest of it in there, the sausage. And of course, you know what? I'll add a little bit of water to that. Rinse my can, put water. And that basically has to come to a boil. And boil 1, 2 minutes to warm up the sausage and the beans. Yeah, this has been boiling for a couple of minutes now. At last, I'll add my garnish. Stir it in there. Look beautiful. Just has to come back to a boil. And let's see what it tastes like. I need salt, again there is no salt in the beans, and pepper. I may even put a dash of Tabasco in there. And this is it. You can do that ahead, of course. And reheated is always good reheated. I wanted to do it for 2, I probably have close to enough for 4. But you would serve it in a bowl like this. And there. Even with a little bit more herbs on top if you want. And this is our make up cassoulet. Easy to do, a few minute, great taste. And happy cooking. And happy cooking. And happy cooking.", "confidence": 0.83286643, "words": [{"word": "hi", "start": 4.4, "end": 4.8599997, "confidence": 0.98807764, "punctuated_word": "Hi,"}, {"word": "i'm", "start": 4.8599997, "end":

{"transcript": "\nHi, I'm Jacques Pepin and I'm cooking at home. There is a famous dish in the southwest of France called cassoulet. You cook beans usually, there is duck in it, all kinds of sausage in it. It's a very famous dish, which now I'm going to do a kind of bastardized version of it, very easy to do. And I'll start by putting a little bit of olive oil in there and I have 3 sausage here that I find in my freezer.\n\nThis is an Italian type sausage, which is raw meat. So I'm gonna cut that into pieces like this. Okay, because this has to cook. I'm gonna put that to cook directly in there. Okay.\n\nAnd then I have 2 other sausage here. This is a type of a bratwurst or kielbasa. Bit of the same idea. Those are cooked sausage. So they can go later.\n\nAnd this is, as you can see, a hot dog. So that's good too. All right. I am going to put an onion. And this, of course, we can do it ahead.\n\nYou can do it, of course, with dry beans, but it makes it very easy to do it a few minutes here. Like this, and the garlic, you know, Just coarsely chopped and cooked in there. All right. Just cook that 2, 3 minutes. So maybe I could add this to it.\n\nI'm gonna saute that for a minute. And what I have here, I have a can of, well, cannellini beans or butter beans or white, tiny white beans. Anyway, even the red beans too, it's a question of choice what you have in your refrigerator. And to cook this, what I'm going to do is to pour the water that I have in there. Yeah.\n\nAnd I'm going to cook for a few minutes, for a couple of minutes with that water. Actually, I could even cover that 2, 3 minute. And during that time, I can do my garnish here for the hands. So As you see, I have a little piece of tomato, probably third of a cup or so. Bit of garlic, again.\n\nCan never be enough garlic for me. So I chop that. And if I were to do that ahead, I would do what I did there. And after I'm going to add the other sausage in it too, but I would not add what I have here, which is parsley, the tomato and the garlic. I would add that only when I'm serving it.\n\nJust to bring it to a boil and serve it, but that you could do that a few hours ahead. Yeah, that's fine. I can see this has cooked. Yeah, the onion is about cooked. So let's put the rest of it in there, the sausage.\n\nAnd of course, you know what? I'll add a little bit of water to that. Rinse my can, put water. And that basically has to come to a boil. And boil 1, 2 minutes to warm up the sausage and the beans.\n\nYeah, this has been boiling for a couple of minutes now. At last, I'll add my garnish. Stir it in there. Look beautiful. Just has to come back to a boil.\n\nAnd let's see what it tastes like. I need salt, again there is no salt in the beans, and pepper. I may even put a dash of Tabasco in there. And this is it. You can do that ahead, of course.\n\nAnd reheated is always good reheated. I wanted to do it for 2, I probably have close to enough for 4. But you would serve it in a bowl like this. And there. Even with a little bit more herbs on top if you want.\n\nAnd this is our make up cassoulet. Easy to do, a few minute, great taste. And happy cooking. And happy cooking.

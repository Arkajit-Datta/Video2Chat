I love to do simple lunch and I love to use canned tuna, canned sardine, canned anchovy, and there is many on the market. Try to get it usually from Spain or Portugal. These are very large sardines in tomato sauce. So you put that on a nice tray. I always have lettuce at the house. So I put a little bit of lettuce around. 1 of the favorite dish of my wife, right? So we put sardine around. I have some onion here. Now we're talking about, of course, Sweet onion, Vidalia onion, like that, not too strong. And that we're gonna put it a little bit all over. I happen to have a tomato here. If I don't have it, I don't use it. But if I have it, I use it to finish our lunch. I will cut that into wedge, like this. You know, to put it around Like this. Always a good dash of red wine vinegar that goes well with it. Often I put olive oil on top, not in this 1, there is enough sauce. And you know, my garden is starting to give me some fresh herb, parsley and all that. Crack pepper on top of that, black pepper. And this is it. Simple lunch. I think it's elegant. Very good for you. With a nice piece of bread.

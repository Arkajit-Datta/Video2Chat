I want to show you how to make properly hard-cooked eggs and off-mole, that is a softer 1. The first thing that you do in the round part of the egg, you make a little hole. Because there is the air chamber, that releases the pressure. Very often, you put that in boiling water, the egg will crack. That will release the pressure. So that you can see it, I'm going to stop the boiling here and show it to you. You will see that when I put that in there, the pressure will be released because of that. So here we go. Here, you can see it going down. And the second 1 here. Again, I'm putting the heat back on. I don't really want it to boil very strongly. Very, very gentle boil. If it boils too fast, it toughens the albumin. The egg white will be tough. We're going to put that on 10 minutes for the large eggs. 10 minutes and 7 minutes for the egg mole. When you put the eggs into the boiling water, the sulfur in the eggs, you know what smell, the smell of rotten eggs, it get away from the heat. It goes toward the center of the egg. And there is a reaction with the yolk, the iron in the yolk. And it creates that blue tinge that you have around your yolk and that strong smell of sulfur. So what we'll have to do, as soon as the egg is cooked, we Take it out, put it into ice cold water. Then the sulfur fill the coal, cross the egg white and dissipate in the water. So you have an egg without any, you know, any of that green tinge around the yolk and very nice and tender. Okay. I remove this 1 at 7 minutes, this 01:10 minutes. Ice cold water, I let it cool in there. And now, for the poached eggs, you do in water, with a little bit of vinegar on top. The vinegar, Of course, prevent the egg white from spreading out too much. We used to break 10 eggs in a row when I was in that relationship. But if you do 1 or 2 eggs, maybe it's good to break 1 directly in there and then place it into barely boiling water like this. Okay. So, the eggs usually will come a little bit to the surface. You help maybe with a slotted spoon like that when it start going up. And of course it goes between 4, 5 minutes, 6 minutes, depending on how you like your eggs. It's important also for the eggs, you have your eggs cold. Rather, if it's at room temperature, the egg white tend to spread out more. And here, as I say, you can pull it out gently like this, just by running it. That makes it move. That's it. Every couple minutes, you can lift it up and test it, see the way you like it. Usually about 5 minutes. This is the hard cooked eggs. You want to eat it with a spoon like that. It goes into the ice water. And frankly, the best way of peeling it, it's under running water. Under the shell, you have a skin. You have to break through that skin and the running water in the sink go under and it makes it easy. Yeah, the egg is soft now and then again you would put that into water and ice. That's to cool off your egg and also to wash a bit of the vinegar. In a professional kitchen, you will poach 2 dozen eggs this way. Now, usually, your poached egg, you trim some of the hanging white like this. You look at it, there is 1 side, well, look a bit better than the other side. That's how you present it, either this way or this way. And then you keep them in cold water. When someone has an order, you grab that egg, lower it into hot water for 20, 30 seconds and serve it. This is our egg mole, which basically is another way of doing a poached egg. I very often do it this way rather than this, same texture. And this is the hard cooked eggs that I have here. You can see that the hard cooked eggs, I will cut right through and the yolk will be absolutely beautiful. No green tinge around the yolk, no smell of sulfur. For me going to a restaurant and having a perfectly cooked, hard cooked egg is an indication of knowledge in the kitchen. This is the egg mole, very soft, which is about 7 minutes, 6 and a half, 7 minutes. And as you can see, it's basically like a poached egg. Sometimes easier to do than the poached egg. And then finally the poached egg here. Again, the texture will be about the same here. Poached eggs, off mollet, and hard-cooked eggs. There is another egg that I've done here, cooked at low temperature. Usually, people do it when you cook sous vide with a circulator or an agitator where the water is mixed. It's cooked at 150 degrees, you know, much lower than the 212, which is boiling water. And it's cooked for, I cook this 1 for 1 hour. And as you see, it comes out, you don't shell it, it comes out this way. The texture of the yolk is almost like the same texture of the yolk and the white together. Quite moist and a different texture than those. So there are 4 different ways of cooking your eggs. I love to do that with the kid. I have 2 eggs here. Which 1 is hard cooked? This 1 is raw. 1 is raw, 1 is hard cooked. And what you do, you spin the egg. Like this 1 here, basically doesn't spin. This is the raw egg. This 1 here, it goes so much that it stand up like this because it's totally solid. So, so you know, the kid loves to do that. So, whoop, again, here is the hard cooked egg and here is the raw egg. And the more it cooked, if it's halfway cooked, it will spin more, more, more, and more, eventually standing up like this. Happy cooking.

{"transcript": "\nHi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I want to show you how to make properly hard-cooked eggs and off-mole, that is a softer 1. The first thing that you do in the round part of the egg, you make a little hole. Because there is the air chamber, that releases the pressure. Very often, you put that in boiling water, the egg will crack.\n\nThat will release the pressure. So that you can see it, I'm going to stop the boiling here and show it to you. You will see that when I put that in there, the pressure will be released because of that. So here we go. Here, you can see it going down.\n\nAnd the second 1 here. Again, I'm putting the heat back on. I don't really want it to boil very strongly. Very, very gentle boil. If it boils too fast, it toughens the albumin.\n\nThe egg white will be tough. We're going to put that on 10 minutes for the large eggs. 10 minutes and 7 minutes for the egg mole. When you put the eggs into the boiling water, the sulfur in the eggs, you know what smell, the smell of rotten eggs, it get away from the heat. It goes toward the center of the egg.\n\nAnd there is a reaction with the yolk, the iron in the yolk. And it creates that blue tinge that you have around your yolk and that strong smell of sulfur. So what we'll have to do, as soon as the egg is cooked, we Take it out, put it into ice cold water. Then the sulfur fill the coal, cross the egg white and dissipate in the water. So you have an egg without any, you know, any of that green tinge around the yolk and very nice and tender.\n\nOkay. I remove this 1 at 7 minutes, this 01:10 minutes. Ice cold water, I let it cool in there. And now, for the poached eggs, you do in water, with a little bit of vinegar on top. The vinegar, Of course, prevent the egg white from spreading out too much.\n\nWe used to break 10 eggs in a row when I was in that relationship. But if you do 1 or 2 eggs, maybe it's good to break 1 directly in there and then place it into barely boiling water like this. Okay. So, the eggs usually will come a little bit to the surface. You help maybe with a slotted spoon like that when it start going up.\n\nAnd of course it goes between 4, 5 minutes, 6 minutes, depending on how you like your eggs. It's important also for the eggs, you have your eggs cold. Rather, if it's at room temperature, the egg white tend to spread out more. And here, as I say, you can pull it out gently like this, just by running it. That makes it move.\n\nThat's it. Every couple minutes, you can lift it up and test it, see the way you like it. Usually about 5 minutes. This is the hard cooked eggs. You want to eat it with a spoon like that.\n\nIt goes into the ice water. And frankly, the best way of peeling it, it's under running water. Under the shell, you have a skin. You have to break through that skin and the running water in the sink go under and it makes it easy. Yeah, the egg is soft now and then again you would put that into water and ice.\n\nThat's to cool off your egg and also to wash a bit of the vinegar. In a professional kitchen, you will poach 2 dozen eggs this way. Now, usually, your poached egg, you trim some of the hanging white like this. You look at it, there is 1 side, well, look a bit better than the other side. That's how you present it, either this way or this way.\n\nAnd then you keep them in cold water. When someone has an order, you grab that egg, lower it into hot water for 20, 30 seconds and serve it. This is our egg mole, which basically is another way of doing a poached egg. I very often do it this way rather than this, same texture. And this is the hard cooked eggs that I have here.\n\nYou can see that the hard cooked eggs, I will cut right through and the yolk will be absolutely beautiful. No green tinge around the yolk, no smell of sulfur. For me going to a restaurant and having a perfectly cooked, hard cooked egg is an indication of knowledge in the kitchen. This is the egg mole, very soft, which is about 7 minutes, 6 and a half, 7 minutes. And as you can see, it's basically like a poached egg.\n\nSometimes easier to do than the poached egg. And then finally the poached egg here. Again, the texture will be about the same here. Poached eggs, off mollet, and hard-cooked eggs. There is another egg that I've done here, cooked at low temperature.\n\nUsually, people do it when you cook sous vide with a circulator or an agitator where the water is mixed. It's cooked at 150 degrees, you know, much lower than the 212, which is boiling water. And it's cooked for, I cook this 1 for 1 hour. And as you see, it comes out, you don't shell it, it comes out this way. The texture of the yolk is almost like the same texture of the yolk and the white together.\n\nQuite moist and a different texture than those. So there are 4 different ways of cooking your eggs. I love to do that with the kid. I have 2 eggs here. Which 1 is hard cooked?\n\nThis 1 is raw. 1 is raw, 1 is hard cooked. And what you do, you spin the egg. Like this 1 here, basically doesn't spin. This is the raw egg.\n\nThis 1 here, it goes so much that it stand up like this because it's totally solid. So, so you know, the kid loves to do that. So, whoop, again, here is the hard cooked egg and here is the raw egg. And the more it cooked, if it's halfway cooked, it will spin more, more, more, and more, eventually standing up like this. Happy cooking.\n\nYou", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home.", "start": 0.29999998, "end": 3.6799998}, {"text": "I want to show you how to make

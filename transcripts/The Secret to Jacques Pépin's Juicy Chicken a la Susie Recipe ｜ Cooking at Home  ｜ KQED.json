This is a simple recipe that my friend Suzy told me about. She does that with the breast of turkey, with the skin on. She does that for years. So that gave me an idea, so I'm going to do it with chicken. As you can see, it's very easy for 2 here. I have 2 breast of chicken, and I'm going to put half a teaspoon of salt on it. I would say a good teaspoon of hot sauce. This is maybe a teaspoon and a half. This is garlic chili sauce, which you could use all the time if you want. So I spread that underneath, put that into a gratin dish this way. And now for the top, I have a third of a cup of mayonnaise here. It's a lot of mayonnaise. Goes on top. And again, here, a good teaspoon of the hot sauce. I mix it together. And also notice that I kind of dry out the chicken a little bit to make sure that they are really loaded with mayonnaise on top. Of course, you can prepare that ahead a little bit if you want. I've never done a chicken hot like that with mayonnaise. It was due to me, but it make an inside very, very moist. Good. And that goes now in a 400 degree oven for like 25 minutes. That's it. And this is it. 25 minutes, 400 degree oven. And you can see beautifully brown. A nice sauce underneath. But I want to show you how moist that thing is inside. That chicken is very, very juicy and moist inside. Great way of doing it. This in the sauce. That's it. The chicken with a mayonnaise coating, and I thought a bit of color there. And see the breast Chicken \u00e0 la susie. Happy cooking. \u266a\u266a\u266a", "confidence": 0.81140924, "words": [{"word": "hi", "start": 0.29999998, "end": 0.79999995, "confidence": 0.9867138, "punctuated_word": "Hi,"}, {"word": "i'm",

This is a simple recipe that my friend Suzy told me about. She does that with the breast of turkey, with the skin on. She does that for years. So that gave me an idea, so I'm going to do it with chicken.\n\nAs you can see, it's very easy for 2 here. I have 2 breast of chicken, and I'm going to put half a teaspoon of salt on it. I would say a good teaspoon of hot sauce. This is maybe a teaspoon and a half. This is garlic chili sauce, which you could use all the time if you want.\n\nSo I spread that underneath, put that into a gratin dish this way. And now for the top, I have a third of a cup of mayonnaise here. It's a lot of mayonnaise. Goes on top. And again, here, a good teaspoon of the hot sauce.\n\nI mix it together. And also notice that I kind of dry out the chicken a little bit to make sure that they are really loaded with mayonnaise on top. Of course, you can prepare that ahead a little bit if you want. I've never done a chicken hot like that with mayonnaise. It was due to me, but it make an inside very, very moist.\n\nGood. And that goes now in a 400 degree oven for like 25 minutes. That's it. And this is it. 25 minutes, 400 degree oven.\n\nAnd you can see beautifully brown. A nice sauce underneath. But I want to show you how moist that thing is inside. That chicken is very, very juicy and moist inside. Great way of doing it.\n\nThis in the sauce. That's it. The chicken with a mayonnaise coating, and I thought a bit of color there. And see the breast Chicken \u00e0 la susie. Happy cooking.\n\n\u266a\u266a\u266a", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin and I'm cooking at home.", "start": 0.29999998, "end": 3.6799998}, {"text": "This is a simple recipe that my friend Suzy told me about.", "start": 5.22, "end": 9.88}, {"text": "She does that with the breast of turkey, with the skin on.", "start": 9.88, "end": 14.759999}, {"text": "She does that for years.", "start": 15.06, "end": 16.42}, {"text": "So that gave me an idea, so I'm going to do it with chicken.", "start": 16.44, "end": 19.26}], "start": 0.29999998, "end": 19.26, "num_words": 52}, {"sentences": [{"text": "As you can see, it's very easy for 2 here.", "start": 19.279999, "end": 21.82}, {"text": "I have 2 breast of chicken, and I'm going to put half a teaspoon of salt on it.", "start": 21.82, "end": 28.98}, {"text": "I would say a good teaspoon of hot sauce.", "start": 29.099998, "end": 32.86}, {"text": "This is maybe a teaspoon and a half.", "start": 33.42, "end": 36.8}, {"text": "This is garlic chili sauce, which you could use all the time if you want.", "start": 37.04, "end": 44.04}], "start": 19.279999, "end": 44.04, "num_words": 60}, {"sentences": [{"text": "So I spread that underneath, put that into a gratin dish this way.", "start": 44.04, "end": 51.14}, {"text": "And now for the top, I have a third of a cup of mayonnaise here.", "start": 53.08, "end": 59.88}, {"text": "It's a lot of mayonnaise.", "start": 61.36, "end": 62.559998}, {"text": "Goes on top.", "start": 63.66, "end": 64.7}, {"text": "And again, here, a good teaspoon of the hot sauce.", "start": 65.8, "end": 73.02}], "start": 44.04, "end": 73.02, "num_words": 46}, {"sentences": [{"text": "I mix it together.", "start": 73.2, "end": 74.32}, {"text": "And also notice that I kind of dry out the chicken a little bit to make sure that they are really loaded with mayonnaise on top.", "start": 75.18, "end": 87.22}, {"text": "Of course, you can prepare that ahead a little bit if you want.", "start": 87.62, "end": 90.86}, {"text": "I've never done a chicken hot like that with mayonnaise.", "start": 91.44, "end": 96.92}, {"text": "It was due to me, but it make an inside very, very moist.", "start": 98.16, "end": 103.22}], "start": 73.2, "end": 103.22, "num_words": 66}, {"sentences": [{"text": "Good.", "start": 105.54, "end": 106.04}, {"text": "And that goes now in a 400 degree oven for like 25 minutes.", "start": 106.72, "end": 111.24}, {"text": "That's it.", "start": 115.84, "end": 116.56}, {"text": "And this is it.", "start": 117.979996, "end": 119.28}, {"text": "25 minutes, 400 degree oven.", "start": 119.64, "end": 121.86}], "start": 105.54, "end": 121.86, "num_words": 25}, {"sentences": [{"text": "And you can see beautifully brown.", "start": 122.38, "end": 124.4}, {"text": "A nice sauce underneath.", "start": 125.56, "end": 127.5}, {"text": "But I want to show you how moist that thing is inside.", "start": 128.36, "end": 135.04}, {"text": "That chicken is very, very juicy and moist inside.", "start": 137.9, "end": 142.7}, {"text": "Great way of doing it.", "start": 143.3, "end": 144.72}], "start": 122.38, "end": 144.72, "num_words": 36}, {"sentences": [{"text": "This in the sauce.", "start": 145.58, "end": 148.22}, {"text": "That's it.", "start": 151.52, "end": 152.3}, {"text": "The chicken with a mayonnaise coating, and I thought a bit of color there.", "start": 154.02, "end": 162.22}, {"text": "And see the breast Chicken \u00e0 la susie.", "start": 163.66, "end": 166.36}, {"text": "Happy cooking.", "start": 166.86, "end": 167.66}], "start": 145.58, "end": 167.66, "num_words": 30}, {"sentences": [{"text": "\u266a\u266a\u266a", "start": 168.4, "end": 168.9}], "start": 168.4, "end": 168.9, "num_words": 1}]}}]}]}}

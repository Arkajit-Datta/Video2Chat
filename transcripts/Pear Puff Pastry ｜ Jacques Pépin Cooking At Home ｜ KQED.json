You know, sometimes I make puff paste, which is a pretty complicated process, but very often I buy it at the supermarket. I'm doing a dessert for 2. I have a large pear, which is a little bit damaged here. So I'm gonna peel it and use it with a layer of puff paste on top. Puff paste is of course a complicated process of doing dough, which is flour and water, and spreading it out and covering it with a lot of butter. And then you fold it and spread it, and fold it and spread it to get multi-layer effect that you have in a Napoleon, Vol-au-vent, those type of thing. Again, here, make sure you put your thumb the right way here when you take the center of this. This is a pear which is pretty ripe, you know, but even if it's not as ripe, it will work well with that recipe. So here we are. Putting it here and there. I'll put a little bit of sugar here. I'm gonna put a little bit of melted butter on top of this. A dash of apricot. You don't have to, or peach. Peach or apricot. Make the sauce around and maybe a little bit of water. We're like 223 tablespoons. Then I have that piece of puff paste that as you can see, it's a little freezer burn here on the side, but it's okay. I'm gonna put it around there, and around here. It's an easy way of doing it. Then I'll brush it with a bit of butter here. That always helps. So I have about a tablespoon and a half of butter all together here. And then maybe a good 1, 2 teaspoon of sugar on top. And that's it. That's going to go into the oven for like 30 minutes about. Well, back to the pear in puff paste. They have been out of the oven about 10 minutes. They stay 400 degrees for like 30, 35 minutes in the oven and they're still warm. And that's it. I like to serve them lukewarm. There is a little bit of syrup coming out of it. Beautiful. Let's see the inside. Pork place is nice and crispy on top. Whoop, making a mess. That's a very elegant dessert, which I hope you do for your and all your family.

I'm cooking at home. You know, sometimes I make puff paste, which is a pretty complicated process, but very often I buy it at the supermarket. I'm doing a dessert for 2. I have a large pear, which is a little bit damaged here. So I'm gonna peel it and use it with a layer of puff paste on top.\n\nPuff paste is of course a complicated process of doing dough, which is flour and water, and spreading it out and covering it with a lot of butter. And then you fold it and spread it, and fold it and spread it to get multi-layer effect that you have in a Napoleon, Vol-au-vent, those type of thing. Again, here, make sure you put your thumb the right way here when you take the center of this. This is a pear which is pretty ripe, you know, but even if it's not as ripe, it will work well with that recipe. So here we are.\n\nPutting it here and there. I'll put a little bit of sugar here. I'm gonna put a little bit of melted butter on top of this. A dash of apricot. You don't have to, or peach.\n\nPeach or apricot. Make the sauce around and maybe a little bit of water. We're like 223 tablespoons. Then I have that piece of puff paste that as you can see, it's a little freezer burn here on the side, but it's okay. I'm gonna put it around there, and around here.\n\nIt's an easy way of doing it. Then I'll brush it with a bit of butter here. That always helps. So I have about a tablespoon and a half of butter all together here. And then maybe a good 1, 2 teaspoon of sugar on top.\n\nAnd that's it. That's going to go into the oven for like 30 minutes about. Well, back to the pear in puff paste. They have been out of the oven about 10 minutes. They stay 400 degrees for like 30, 35 minutes in the oven and they're still warm.\n\nAnd that's it. I like to serve them lukewarm. There is a little bit of syrup coming out of it. Beautiful. Let's see the inside.\n\nPork place is nice and crispy on top. Whoop, making a mess. That's a very elegant dessert, which I hope you do for your and all your family.

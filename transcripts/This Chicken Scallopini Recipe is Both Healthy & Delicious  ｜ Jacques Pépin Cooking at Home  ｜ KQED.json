Very often when I use chicken, chicken thigh, 1 of my favorite, especially stewing and all that. But the chicken breast like that is very good. I use it, We used to get a lot of veal in the market. We can't. So I use it in the same way. In thin scallopini, the chicken breast, you cannot overcook it. It has to be moist and tender. This is 1 single chicken breast, and it's enough for 2 people. I'm going to do this with a bit of zucchini here. And I will start with the zucchini. I'm going to cut it this way, this way. I got 3 slice and 3 here. I keep a little bit of the center. It's too much seed. And cut it into a julienne we call here, cut it into thin strip like this. Of course, this is a garnish that you don't have to do. You can serve that with spinach, you can serve that with carrot, You can serve that with potato. And I want to put a couple of tablespoons of oil in there with olive oil. And this doesn't have to saute very long. This 1 I make it right through, you could eat the end of it. And at the end of it, It doesn't seem to have as much seed as it does on the other side. Salt. And then I'm gonna saute that for a couple of minutes. Here, I'm gonna cut that on the side into scallopini like this, that is long. As I said, we used to do that a lot with veal. I can do the same way here. Sometimes we bread it. We used to bread the veal, 123. Maybe this 1 a little bigger. I cut it to open it this way. So they're all about the same thickness. This is going to cook a minute on each side. Salt on top of this. On each side. I could also put flour, but I'm not going. A bit of Spanish paprika. This side. This side. And eventually, I'll put a bit of shallot at the end. I cut that in half. Okay, this is about ready. You could do that a little bit ahead, keep that warm. In, you know, 130, 140 degree oven. Now I want to put a good tablespoon of butter in there. And maybe a couple of teaspoon of oil. Okay, now it's about, I'll enter this. This. And this. A bit tight, but it's good. It's about a minute, minute and a half now, while stirring it. And another minute on this side at the most, and I think at that point I can put my shallots in it. So we finish cooking around. Maybe a dash of green on top. Well, you can see my single breast of chicken is more than enough for 2. Giving you 2 scallopini per person. Of course, don't forget your shallots on top here. Maybe a little bit of green. And here it is, the scallopini of chicken with zucchini fit for a king. Happy cooking. \u266a\u266a Thank you.

Very often when I use chicken, chicken thigh, 1 of my favorite, especially stewing and all that. But the chicken breast like that is very good. I use it, We used to get a lot of veal in the market. We can't.\n\nSo I use it in the same way. In thin scallopini, the chicken breast, you cannot overcook it. It has to be moist and tender. This is 1 single chicken breast, and it's enough for 2 people. I'm going to do this with a bit of zucchini here.\n\nAnd I will start with the zucchini. I'm going to cut it this way, this way. I got 3 slice and 3 here. I keep a little bit of the center. It's too much seed.\n\nAnd cut it into a julienne we call here, cut it into thin strip like this. Of course, this is a garnish that you don't have to do. You can serve that with spinach, you can serve that with carrot, You can serve that with potato. And I want to put a couple of tablespoons of oil in there with olive oil. And this doesn't have to saute very long.\n\nThis 1 I make it right through, you could eat the end of it. And at the end of it, It doesn't seem to have as much seed as it does on the other side. Salt. And then I'm gonna saute that for a couple of minutes. Here, I'm gonna cut that on the side into scallopini like this, that is long.\n\nAs I said, we used to do that a lot with veal. I can do the same way here. Sometimes we bread it. We used to bread the veal, 123. Maybe this 1 a little bigger.\n\nI cut it to open it this way. So they're all about the same thickness. This is going to cook a minute on each side. Salt on top of this. On each side.\n\nI could also put flour, but I'm not going. A bit of Spanish paprika. This side. This side. And eventually, I'll put a bit of shallot at the end.\n\nI cut that in half. Okay, this is about ready. You could do that a little bit ahead, keep that warm. In, you know, 130, 140 degree oven. Now I want to put a good tablespoon of butter in there.\n\nAnd maybe a couple of teaspoon of oil. Okay, now it's about, I'll enter this. This. And this. A bit tight, but it's good.\n\nIt's about a minute, minute and a half now, while stirring it. And another minute on this side at the most, and I think at that point I can put my shallots in it. So we finish cooking around. Maybe a dash of green on top. Well, you can see my single breast of chicken is more than enough for 2.\n\nGiving you 2 scallopini per person. Of course, don't forget your shallots on top here. Maybe a little bit of green. And here it is, the scallopini of chicken with zucchini fit for a king. Happy cooking.\n\n\u266a\u266a Thank you.

I've always had a garden, you know, growing a garden for me is very important in the spring, so when the little thing comes out it's very exciting. I've grown this 1 here probably 20 years ago or so, so that it was pretty high, so I didn't have to bend down too much. And what do you think? So the garden, well, now with the end of August, I like it, especially in the spring when those salads come out. But I have a lot of stuff in the garden, especially herbs, from oregano to thyme to, and what I have maybe more than anything else, because all the way here, growing out of the rock over there, This is arugula. And maybe 15 years ago or so, I was in the south of France and I bought package of arugula, la roquette des jardins in France. And I planted and it's wild. It comes back every year, every year. I pull out half of it. It goes into seed here. I give some to friends, and it's still coming and coming. We have it from the end of April until like October. We are here. And look at those. Those are parsnips. They're a type of carrot, too strong. It's very flavorful to braise or around a roast. That's very good. A lot of basil. I will blanch that basil in boiling water and a dash of salt, a dash of oil with it and make a puree, I do little package, I put that in the freezer during the winter, I can use that for free. The cucumber here, we add a lot, I do cut cucumber soup or anything like this, you know. So it grows like crazy too. I have yellow zucchini. And you can see here and all that. The more we eat, the more it comes out. I mean, that's crazy. The zucchini flowers. And you can see that the zucchini flowers with a thin stem like this in a male. So the male will not create any zucchini. So you take it out and we fry it, you know, fry zucchini flowers. If you see that underneath there is a bulge, that is going to create a zucchini, so you don't pick it up, only the male ones. Favorite from me when I was a kid, certainly the Swiss chard. Swiss chard, we make gratin or Swiss chard or stuff like this too. A lot of chives in many of my recipes, family of onion and all that kind of chives, I have it in 3 or 4 places in the garden. And I cut, when it comes out with the flowers, I cut it down. It grows again with the flowers, I cut it down. You do that a couple of times and after the flowers don't come anymore. That's it. This time we have some of the tomato coming out here. See, another week or so. I pick some up every day when they are ready. I think it's time to make green fried tomato. I have sorrel here and sorrel is a sour kind of sour grass sorrel and we do that especially with salmon, that classic thing. Very high in oxalic acid and all that. We saute. I have parsley there. And of course, a big bunch of sage. Bring them into the house. Claudine tells me bring them into the house just for the smell of it when we have guests. We have thyme, 2 or 3 sizes of thyme. We have rosemary of course, And then we have flowers on this side. This is about my garden for the summer. Always exciting to be able to pick up stuff and cook with it right away.", "confidence": 0.80817294, "words": [{"word": "hi", "start": 0.32, "end": 0.82, "confidence": 0.9789665, "punctuated_word":

cooking at home. I've always had a garden, you know, growing a garden for me is very important in the spring, so when the little thing comes out it's very exciting. I've grown this 1 here probably 20 years ago or so, so that it was pretty high, so I didn't have to bend down too much. And what do you think? So the garden, well, now with the end of August, I like it, especially in the spring when those salads come out.\n\nBut I have a lot of stuff in the garden, especially herbs, from oregano to thyme to, and what I have maybe more than anything else, because all the way here, growing out of the rock over there, This is arugula. And maybe 15 years ago or so, I was in the south of France and I bought package of arugula, la roquette des jardins in France. And I planted and it's wild. It comes back every year, every year. I pull out half of it.\n\nIt goes into seed here. I give some to friends, and it's still coming and coming. We have it from the end of April until like October. We are here. And look at those.\n\nThose are parsnips. They're a type of carrot, too strong. It's very flavorful to braise or around a roast. That's very good. A lot of basil.\n\nI will blanch that basil in boiling water and a dash of salt, a dash of oil with it and make a puree, I do little package, I put that in the freezer during the winter, I can use that for free. The cucumber here, we add a lot, I do cut cucumber soup or anything like this, you know. So it grows like crazy too. I have yellow zucchini. And you can see here and all that.\n\nThe more we eat, the more it comes out. I mean, that's crazy. The zucchini flowers. And you can see that the zucchini flowers with a thin stem like this in a male. So the male will not create any zucchini.\n\nSo you take it out and we fry it, you know, fry zucchini flowers. If you see that underneath there is a bulge, that is going to create a zucchini, so you don't pick it up, only the male ones. Favorite from me when I was a kid, certainly the Swiss chard. Swiss chard, we make gratin or Swiss chard or stuff like this too. A lot of chives in many of my recipes, family of onion and all that kind of chives, I have it in 3 or 4 places in the garden.\n\nAnd I cut, when it comes out with the flowers, I cut it down. It grows again with the flowers, I cut it down. You do that a couple of times and after the flowers don't come anymore. That's it. This time we have some of the tomato coming out here.\n\nSee, another week or so. I pick some up every day when they are ready. I think it's time to make green fried tomato. I have sorrel here and sorrel is a sour kind of sour grass sorrel and we do that especially with salmon, that classic thing. Very high in oxalic acid and all that.\n\nWe saute. I have parsley there. And of course, a big bunch of sage. Bring them into the house. Claudine tells me bring them into the house just for the smell of it when we have guests.\n\nWe have thyme, 2 or 3 sizes of thyme. We have rosemary of course, And then we have flowers on this side. This is about my garden for the summer.

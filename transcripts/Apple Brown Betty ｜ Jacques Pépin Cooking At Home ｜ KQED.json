I developed that recipe when I work in restaurant. I never waste anything. So apple brown berry or pear, We use different type of fruit. And I used to go in the morning in the pastry shop, see what's leftover. Cake, Danish pastry, croissant, cookie, muffin. Any of this I would put together. Like here I have some of those cookie, sweet cookie. My wife loves those cookie, but they are soft. So I put that in there. I put sugar as well. The amount of sugar is going to be determined by what you have here. And even I went to the Chinese restaurant the other night, I had those cookies, so I'll use the cookie as well. I'm gonna put that here. And I have about maybe 8, 10 ounce of mixture here. And depending on how much fruit you have, this will be enough for probably 6 people at the most, maybe. Oh, here I have that here. I'm gonna put like a good teaspoon, maybe a little more of the cinnamon. You don't have to put the cinnamon. I have like a quarter of a cup of raisins here, golden raisins. Brown sugar, I will put half a cup, or maybe even a dash more, because as I said, I have bread, I don't really have any sugar in there. A couple of tablespoon of apricot here, preserve. And I have about 3 quarter of a cup of orange juice. All stuff that I have in my refrigerator. And I will mix that together. You know, what I used to do in there was actually to put, especially with apple, I used to put apple juice. You could put, but also apple marmalade, you know, the puree of apple. I have a pear, which is a little damaged, as you can see here, that I on the table. So I'm going to use that pear here, peel it and I remove the damaged part. Okay. Cut it in half. Again in half. I have that apple here. When you want to take the core of that apple, you get the knife to the end, you put your thumb here and you cut around like this. Now you have to be very careful. You know, this is dangerous. Put your thumb here, make sure if you don't put your thumb, you go right through. So it's a technique which is very important. So that much here. I do the same thing on the other side. I can peel it by knife or with the vegetable peeler. It's perfectly fine. 1 or the other. Okay. Cut it in half. And you see again, the center is the same way here. You can put your thumb here and remove that part here, but with your thumb here. Okay. Now we just have to mix it. This you can do ahead, actually you should do it ahead a little bit so the bread and all that kind of soften a little bit with the juice. You have a nice gratin dish here. And that should fit in there, hopefully. Yep. And that's gonna cook in the oven 45 minutes in like 400 degree. And here is my apple brown belly. Been out of the oven 15 minutes, but nice and very creamy and cooked. I give the pear. All the liquid has been absorbed there and you don't see any more of the bread and so forth. Maybe a little bit of a sour cream on top of this or creme fraiche. That make really a beautiful dessert. When you have guests at home and stuff left in your refrigerator, don't hesitate, try that recipe. I know you'll enjoy it.

I developed that recipe when I work in restaurant. I never waste anything. So apple brown berry or pear, We use different type of fruit. And I used to go in the morning in the pastry shop, see what's leftover.\n\nCake, Danish pastry, croissant, cookie, muffin. Any of this I would put together. Like here I have some of those cookie, sweet cookie. My wife loves those cookie, but they are soft. So I put that in there.\n\nI put sugar as well. The amount of sugar is going to be determined by what you have here. And even I went to the Chinese restaurant the other night, I had those cookies, so I'll use the cookie as well. I'm gonna put that here. And I have about maybe 8, 10 ounce of mixture here.\n\nAnd depending on how much fruit you have, this will be enough for probably 6 people at the most, maybe. Oh, here I have that here. I'm gonna put like a good teaspoon, maybe a little more of the cinnamon. You don't have to put the cinnamon. I have like a quarter of a cup of raisins here, golden raisins.\n\nBrown sugar, I will put half a cup, or maybe even a dash more, because as I said, I have bread, I don't really have any sugar in there. A couple of tablespoon of apricot here, preserve. And I have about 3 quarter of a cup of orange juice. All stuff that I have in my refrigerator. And I will mix that together.\n\nYou know, what I used to do in there was actually to put, especially with apple, I used to put apple juice. You could put, but also apple marmalade, you know, the puree of apple. I have a pear, which is a little damaged, as you can see here, that I on the table. So I'm going to use that pear here, peel it and I remove the damaged part. Okay.\n\nCut it in half. Again in half. I have that apple here. When you want to take the core of that apple, you get the knife to the end, you put your thumb here and you cut around like this. Now you have to be very careful.\n\nYou know, this is dangerous. Put your thumb here, make sure if you don't put your thumb, you go right through. So it's a technique which is very important. So that much here. I do the same thing on the other side.\n\nI can peel it by knife or with the vegetable peeler. It's perfectly fine. 1 or the other. Okay. Cut it in half.\n\nAnd you see again, the center is the same way here. You can put your thumb here and remove that part here, but with your thumb here. Okay. Now we just have to mix it. This you can do ahead, actually you should do it ahead a little bit so the bread and all that kind of soften a little bit with the juice.\n\nYou have a nice gratin dish here. And that should fit in there, hopefully. Yep. And that's gonna cook in the oven 45 minutes in like 400 degree. And here is my apple brown belly.\n\nBeen out of the oven 15 minutes, but nice and very creamy and cooked. I give the pear. All the liquid has been absorbed there and you don't see any more of the bread and so forth. Maybe a little bit of a sour cream on top of this or creme fraiche. That make really a beautiful dessert.\n\nWhen you have guests at home and stuff left in your refrigerator, don't hesitate, try that recipe. I know you'll enjoy it.

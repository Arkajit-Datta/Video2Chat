I've done shows with my granddaughter. I even did a little book. If I listen to her, all we would do is chocolate. She loves chocolate. And this is 1 of her favorite treats and really easy to do. And I took the idea here from my friend Jacques Torres, the great chocolatier. So I melt chocolate here. And this is bittersweet chocolate or semi-sweet chocolate. I have it and I have Rice Krispie here, cornflake, 2 of my favorite things. So we put that together here on this 1, This 1 here. I mean, you can have more cornflakes or more of 1, more of the other and so forth. And we mix it together like this. Yeah, yeah. And that's it. It's about all there is to it. So now we're ready to do a little package of this. You know, that you put together like this. A little treat. The kid loves that. And it's so easy to do. You can of course do it with nuts. Sometimes I do it with hazelnut rather than that. And it's very good as well. So here is the cornflake. Go here. Okay. I wanna make a mess here. Out of it. Here is my cornflake. When I first came to this country, I learned how to eat cornflake and rice crispy at my friend Pierre Frenet at his house. And that's over 50 years ago. And at that time, it was those little box, that you cut the little box and you open it, pour the milk into it, and do that. I thought it was terrific. I'd never seen that in France. In fact, I cannot find those anymore. So here we are, goes into the refrigerator half an hour, an hour, then you're ready to serve. This is it. It's hot now, you can see it comes out. This is nonstick aluminum foil, you know, crispy. That is really good. My granddaughter will be happy. I put that on the side for her. And I'm ready for her visit.

I've done shows with my granddaughter. I even did a little book. If I listen to her, all we would do is chocolate. She loves chocolate.\n\nAnd this is 1 of her favorite treats and really easy to do. And I took the idea here from my friend Jacques Torres, the great chocolatier. So I melt chocolate here. And this is bittersweet chocolate or semi-sweet chocolate. I have it and I have Rice Krispie here, cornflake, 2 of my favorite things.\n\nSo we put that together here on this 1, This 1 here. I mean, you can have more cornflakes or more of 1, more of the other and so forth. And we mix it together like this. Yeah, yeah. And that's it.\n\nIt's about all there is to it. So now we're ready to do a little package of this. You know, that you put together like this. A little treat. The kid loves that.\n\nAnd it's so easy to do. You can of course do it with nuts. Sometimes I do it with hazelnut rather than that. And it's very good as well. So here is the cornflake.\n\nGo here. Okay. I wanna make a mess here. Out of it. Here is my cornflake.\n\nWhen I first came to this country, I learned how to eat cornflake and rice crispy at my friend Pierre Frenet at his house. And that's over 50 years ago. And at that time, it was those little box, that you cut the little box and you open it, pour the milk into it, and do that. I thought it was terrific. I'd never seen that in France.\n\nIn fact, I cannot find those anymore. So here we are, goes into the refrigerator half an hour, an hour, then you're ready to serve. This is it. It's hot now, you can see it comes out. This is nonstick aluminum foil, you know, crispy.\n\nThat is really good. My granddaughter will be happy. I put that on the side for her. And I'm ready for her visit.

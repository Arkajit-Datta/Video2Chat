Today I'm going to show you how to make candied peel of citrus fruit. Very expensive in the store and very easy to do. I use the vegetable peeler to take long strip. This is a grapefruit. Of course, I have orange, which is mostly I do usually with the orange. And as you can see with this, I'm taking only the top part of the skin. And that's relatively important. So you have like a dozen ones. You can have lemon as well. You know. And all of that I will put into boiling water to blanch it. It has to be blanched, otherwise it gets very bitter. Now, you don't want to take the thick part of it, because if you take the whole part here, where you have the white piece underneath. You can do it with that, but you have to blanch it at least 2, 3 times, otherwise it's bitter. But it is in that part that you have most of the essential oil. Do you see that? I have some of the essential oil coming out of it. And this, again, in the lemon the same way too. And this is where you have most of the taste, in the top, in those essential oil. So this boiled for like 10 seconds, 10, 15 seconds, usually, and I will drain it. I will drain it in the sink normally. And you can already see the color of that water. You know, it's already, and I would rinse that out, but you don't have to. Back in there now. I have about 3 quarter of a cup of water, half a cup of sugar. And now this is going to cook. Okay, as you can see now, it's boiling, it's boiling nicely. And with the syrup, it's still very light now. So now it's going to take probably 10, 12 minutes at least to go where I want it to go before we dump it in sugar. Okay, now you can see the bubble, the way it cooked. Now it's cooked enough, it's to a break stage. So I'm gonna stop this. Yeah, and it's, yeah, 9 minutes. 9 minutes. So what we do now with this, you want to lift up those, those things and put them in sugar. Okay. 123. Because you want to saturate them with sugar. You can see, for example, that this is the grapefruit and it has a different, slightly different color than the orange. And this is, That's it. You have a syrup here left over and you could use that syrup, of course, keep it for, to do a cocktail with it or something else. But here it is. So What we want there is to saturate that in sugar on each side, you know, here, there, here, there, then flat. Okay, here we are. So here, I did it a couple of times, so now I can use my finger to really, you know, it has to be saturated totally with sugar so it doesn't stick anymore. We do that for Christmas, you know, very often I do it to give it to friend. In 10, 15 minutes, half an hour, they're going to be hard. And you cannot even keep it. If you keep it like this, outside, it get too hard, braise it. So what you do, you put it into a little plastic box like this, you know, and then you can keep them for weeks in your refrigerator. Now you can even make it a bit fancier. You would wait until it's hard because it is not hard enough. Now I have some chocolate here that I melted. And you would, for example, the orange here, dip it maybe halfway through, putting there to cool off, you know? And let's say with the, well, with the lemon, let's say you could do white chocolate and it'd be different. Okay, now if you do it with the chocolate, you can keep it as long in your box as you would keep it without, but you can still keep it for like a week. So here we go. See, very easy to do. Then I can put that in my refrigerator for a few minutes. That's it. About half an hour in the refrigerator, but you can leave it all day, it doesn't matter. Notice that I put it onto non-stick aluminum foil. You know, the part on the, that this is shiny. No, the unshiny part is the non-stick 1. So here is how you can see, probably even hear it. It's hard now. I love to do that for the holiday, you know, Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving or whatever. I love for the holiday to do chocolate like this. And here, another 1 here. And you can see here, beautiful with chocolate, white chocolate, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, any 1 of That is fine. And this is a beautiful dessert and a great gift to give to your friend. Happy cooking. \u266a\u266a Thank you.", "confidence": 0.8138109, "words": [{"word": "hi", "start": 4.4, "end": 4.8599997, "confidence": 0.9900395, "punctuated_word": "Hi,"}, {"word": "i'm", "start":

at home. Today I'm going to show you how to make candied peel of citrus fruit. Very expensive in the store and very easy to do. I use the vegetable peeler to take long strip. This is a grapefruit.\n\nOf course, I have orange, which is mostly I do usually with the orange. And as you can see with this, I'm taking only the top part of the skin. And that's relatively important. So you have like a dozen ones. You can have lemon as well.\n\nYou know. And all of that I will put into boiling water to blanch it. It has to be blanched, otherwise it gets very bitter. Now, you don't want to take the thick part of it, because if you take the whole part here, where you have the white piece underneath. You can do it with that, but you have to blanch it at least 2, 3 times, otherwise it's bitter.\n\nBut it is in that part that you have most of the essential oil. Do you see that? I have some of the essential oil coming out of it. And this, again, in the lemon the same way too. And this is where you have most of the taste, in the top, in those essential oil.\n\nSo this boiled for like 10 seconds, 10, 15 seconds, usually, and I will drain it. I will drain it in the sink normally. And you can already see the color of that water. You know, it's already, and I would rinse that out, but you don't have to. Back in there now.\n\nI have about 3 quarter of a cup of water, half a cup of sugar. And now this is going to cook. Okay, as you can see now, it's boiling, it's boiling nicely. And with the syrup, it's still very light now. So now it's going to take probably 10, 12 minutes at least to go where I want it to go before we dump it in sugar.\n\nOkay, now you can see the bubble, the way it cooked. Now it's cooked enough, it's to a break stage. So I'm gonna stop this. Yeah, and it's, yeah, 9 minutes. 9 minutes.\n\nSo what we do now with this, you want to lift up those, those things and put them in sugar. Okay. 123. Because you want to saturate them with sugar. You can see, for example, that this is the grapefruit and it has a different, slightly different color than the orange.\n\nAnd this is, That's it. You have a syrup here left over and you could use that syrup, of course, keep it for, to do a cocktail with it or something else. But here it is. So What we want there is to saturate that in sugar on each side, you know, here, there, here, there, then flat. Okay, here we are.\n\nSo here, I did it a couple of times, so now I can use my finger to really, you know, it has to be saturated totally with sugar so it doesn't stick anymore. We do that for Christmas, you know, very often I do it to give it to friend. In 10, 15 minutes, half an hour, they're going to be hard. And you cannot even keep it. If you keep it like this, outside, it get too hard, braise it.\n\nSo what you do, you put it into a little plastic box like this, you know, and then you can keep them for weeks in your refrigerator. Now you can even make it a bit fancier. You would wait until it's hard because it is not hard enough. Now I have some chocolate here that I melted. And you would, for example, the orange here, dip it maybe halfway through, putting there to cool off, you know?\n\nAnd let's say with the, well, with the lemon, let's say you could do white chocolate and it'd be different. Okay, now if you do it with the chocolate, you can keep it as long in your box as you would keep it without, but you can still keep it for like a week. So here we go. See, very easy to do. Then I can put that in my refrigerator for a few minutes.\n\nThat's it. About half an hour in the refrigerator, but you can leave it all day, it doesn't matter. Notice that I put it onto non-stick aluminum foil. You know, the part on the, that this is shiny. No, the unshiny part is the non-stick 1.\n\nSo here is how you can see, probably even hear it. It's hard now. I love to do that for the holiday, you know, Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving or whatever. I love for the holiday to do chocolate like this. And here, another 1 here.\n\nAnd you can see here, beautiful with chocolate, white chocolate, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, any 1 of That is fine. And this is a beautiful dessert and a great gift to give to your friend.

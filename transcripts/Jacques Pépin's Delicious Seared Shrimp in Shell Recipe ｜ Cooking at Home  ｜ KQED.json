I want to show you a very easy way to cook those large shrimp. As you see, they have been deveined, and I cook them with the shell. So don't do that if you're not ready to eat with your hand. That's how we like it, cooked in the shell with your hands. So those are large shrimp. And I have about a tablespoon at the most of olive oil in there. Tabasco. I'm going to put a good Quarter of a teaspoon of Tabasco. About a quarter of a teaspoon, a little bit of a minced garlic. Yeah, dry garlic. And a dash of paprika, smoked paprika. Now this would actually be very good if you do it ahead and let it marinate for a while. Oh, and of course, a little bit of salt on top of it. But if you marinate it ahead, don't put the salt. Put the salt only at the last moment. Okay. So what I have here is a very hot pan. Test your pan sometime, you know, with a few drop of water, you go like that, it bead like that, you can see it on top. So that's hot. So we want to put that just this way directly. That's it. And they're going to char a little bit. And this will cook minute and a quarter, minute and a half on each side. All right. So you see they're really sealed. We do that when we go to Amelia Island in the winter. If people who are bored there, and they have fresh shrimp coming out, and it's really, really good. Just seal like this. And here I am now. Put My nose on top. Ooh! Oop. We have it here. Ooh! I dashed olive oil on top. Oh, maybe a bit of herb just for color. And this is it. The seared shrimp with the shell on. Enjoy it with your finger.

I want to show you a very easy way to cook those large shrimp. As you see, they have been deveined, and I cook them with the shell. So don't do that if you're not ready to eat with your hand. That's how we like it, cooked in the shell with your hands.\n\nSo those are large shrimp. And I have about a tablespoon at the most of olive oil in there. Tabasco. I'm going to put a good Quarter of a teaspoon of Tabasco. About a quarter of a teaspoon, a little bit of a minced garlic.\n\nYeah, dry garlic. And a dash of paprika, smoked paprika. Now this would actually be very good if you do it ahead and let it marinate for a while. Oh, and of course, a little bit of salt on top of it. But if you marinate it ahead, don't put the salt.\n\nPut the salt only at the last moment. Okay. So what I have here is a very hot pan. Test your pan sometime, you know, with a few drop of water, you go like that, it bead like that, you can see it on top. So that's hot.\n\nSo we want to put that just this way directly. That's it. And they're going to char a little bit. And this will cook minute and a quarter, minute and a half on each side. All right.\n\nSo you see they're really sealed. We do that when we go to Amelia Island in the winter. If people who are bored there, and they have fresh shrimp coming out, and it's really, really good. Just seal like this. And here I am now.\n\nPut My nose on top. Ooh! Oop. We have it here. Ooh!\n\nI dashed olive oil on top. Oh, maybe a bit of herb just for color. And this is it. The seared shrimp with the shell on. Enjoy it with your finger.\n\nHappy cooking.", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home.", "start": 0.32, "end": 3.54}, {"text": "I want to show you a very easy way to cook those large shrimp.", "start": 4.96, "end": 8.299999}, {"text": "As you see, they have been deveined, and I cook them with the shell.", "start": 8.559999, "end": 12.38}, {"text": "So don't do that if you're not ready to eat with your hand.", "start": 12.719999, "end": 15.7}, {"text": "That's how we like it, cooked in the shell with your hands.", "start": 15.72, "end": 18.9}], "start": 0.32, "end": 18.9, "num_words": 62}, {"sentences": [{"text": "So those are large shrimp.", "start": 18.9, "end": 20.779999}, {"text": "And I have about a tablespoon at the most of olive oil in there.", "start": 21.04, "end": 25.32}, {"text": "Tabasco.", "start": 26.14, "end": 26.64}, {"text": "I'm going to put a good Quarter of a teaspoon of Tabasco.", "start": 27.880001, "end": 33.78}, {"text": "About a quarter of a teaspoon, a little bit of a minced garlic.", "start": 34.66, "end": 39.18}], "start": 18.9, "end": 39.18, "num_words": 45}, {"sentences": [{"text": "Yeah, dry garlic.", "start": 40.32, "end": 41.4}, {"text": "And a dash of paprika, smoked paprika.", "start": 42.04, "end": 44.82}, {"text": "Now this would actually be very good if you do it ahead and let it marinate for a while.", "start": 45.16, "end": 50.9}, {"text": "Oh, and of course, a little bit of salt on top of it.", "start": 51.04, "end": 53.96}, {"text": "But if you marinate it ahead, don't put the salt.", "start": 56.66, "end": 59.38}], "start": 40.32, "end": 59.38, "num_words": 52}, {"sentences": [{"text": "Put the salt only at the last moment.", "start": 59.38, "end": 61.62}, {"text": "Okay.", "start": 62.22, "end": 62.72}, {"text": "So what I have here is a very hot pan.", "start": 64.14, "end": 68.22}, {"text": "Test your pan sometime, you know, with a few drop of water, you go like that, it bead like that, you can see it on top.", "start": 68.56, "end": 75.24}, {"text": "So that's hot.", "start": 75.24, "end": 76.36}], "start": 59.38, "end": 76.36, "num_words": 48}, {"sentences": [{"text": "So we want to put that just this way directly.", "start": 76.5, "end": 84.4}, {"text": "That's it.", "start": 89.32, "end": 90.08}, {"text": "And they're going to char a little bit.", "start": 91.22, "end": 93.38}, {"text": "And this will cook minute and a quarter, minute and a half on each side.", "start": 93.38, "end": 97.4}, {"text": "All right.", "start": 98.76, "end": 99.52}], "start": 76.5, "end": 99.52, "num_words": 37}, {"sentences": [{"text": "So you see they're really sealed.", "start": 100.64, "end": 103.6}, {"text": "We do that when we go to Amelia Island in the winter.", "start": 104.7, "end": 108.26}, {"text": "If people who are bored there, and they have fresh shrimp coming out, and it's really, really good.", "start": 108.74, "end": 114.22}, {"text": "Just seal like this.", "start": 114.24, "end": 115.62}, {"text": "And here I am now.", "start": 116.479996, "end": 117.84}], "start": 100.64, "end": 117.84, "num_words": 45}, {"sentences": [{"text": "Put My nose on top.", "start": 119.03, "end": 121.96}, {"text": "Ooh!", "start": 121.96, "end": 122.46}, {"text": "Oop.", "start": 126.66, "end": 127.16}, {"text": "We have it here.", "start": 129.32, "end": 130.36}, {"text": "Ooh!", "start": 133.78, "end": 134.28}], "start": 119.03, "end": 134.28, "num_words": 12}, {"sentences": [{"text": "I dashed olive oil on top.", "start": 136.5, "end": 139.36}, {"text": "Oh, maybe a bit of herb just for color.", "start": 139.94, "end": 142.1}, {"text": "And this is it.", "start": 144.18, "end": 145.38}, {"text": "The seared shrimp with the shell on.", "start": 147.44, "end": 150.42}, {"text": "Enjoy it with your finger.", "start": 151.22, "end": 152.58}], "start": 136.5, "end": 152.58, "num_words": 31}, {"sentences": [{"text": "Happy cooking.", "start": 152.78, "end": 153.58}], "start": 152.78, "end": 153.58, "num_words": 2}]}}]}]}}

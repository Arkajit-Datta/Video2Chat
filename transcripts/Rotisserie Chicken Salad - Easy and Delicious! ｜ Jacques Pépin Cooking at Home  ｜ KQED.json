You know, sometimes when guests show up at my house unexpectedly or even if I'm invited, I want to bring something, I do that dish here. I go to my market and buy 1 of those rotisserie chicken. They have them all the time, right out of the rotisserie. They are very nice. But then you have to make them your own. And what I do here, that's what I'm going to do here. I have a tablespoon of butter, couple of tablespoon of oil here, third of a cup or whatever of shallot or onion or scallion or any of those that work out fine. Shallots of course is a little bit different than the onion and I have a couple of mushroom. I will use those mushroom, very coarsely sliced here. Couple of time, That goes in there too. This, all of that is going to make this my own chicken. A bit of salt on top of that. I have some garlic here. Those are small clove of garlic. All right, coarse some coarsely. That's it, that will do it. I'm going to add some herb, have some chive, and now I have my chicken. Now I line up a beautiful platter here with a whole lettuce that I bought. There, Those are the, and I can leave the thing or cut them in half like this. Doesn't really matter. And my chicken, I'm going to cut it with the, with this here. Makes it easy. And in my house, we serve the whole chicken, that includes the bone, backbone and all that. In fact, we can have whole fight to eat the bone, pieces with the bone on it. So this is the type of things, of course, you have to eat with friends. You have to eat with friends because you have to eat with your finger. The wing. Okay, here it is here. Something on the other side. So as you can see, I do about 8, 10 piece of chicken that I cut. Okay, Now remember, this is about cooked enough now. There is always the juice here left in the pan. So don't throw that out. Mix it with that. I'm gonna put a little bit of lime juice here on my salad and on the chicken as well. Don't forget to put a bit of salt, especially on the outside on the salad as you want to eat that salad, of course. Pepper. And that's, this is so lukewarm this way, of course. And I have that on top. So you know, I put mushroom in there, I put shallot because I have that in my refrigerator. Look at what you have in your refrigerator. Remember that what you are doing, you are doing the chicken your own. You are making it your own. This. Okay. I have some herb on top even. Dash of olive oil on the outside on my salad. That's about it. Oh, here I have a beautiful tomato from the garden. Might as well use it. Yeah, a yellow tomato from my garden. Yeah. You don't have to do it, or you can put a red tomato or nothing at all. It's fine. Bit of bit of color, taste. Think in terms of color, but more think in terms of taste. It's good if it look good, but it should taste good first. And this is about it. My rotisserie chicken transformed my own way to bring to my friend for dinner.

You know, sometimes when guests show up at my house unexpectedly or even if I'm invited, I want to bring something, I do that dish here. I go to my market and buy 1 of those rotisserie chicken. They have them all the time, right out of the rotisserie. They are very nice.\n\nBut then you have to make them your own. And what I do here, that's what I'm going to do here. I have a tablespoon of butter, couple of tablespoon of oil here, third of a cup or whatever of shallot or onion or scallion or any of those that work out fine. Shallots of course is a little bit different than the onion and I have a couple of mushroom. I will use those mushroom, very coarsely sliced here.\n\nCouple of time, That goes in there too. This, all of that is going to make this my own chicken. A bit of salt on top of that. I have some garlic here. Those are small clove of garlic.\n\nAll right, coarse some coarsely. That's it, that will do it. I'm going to add some herb, have some chive, and now I have my chicken. Now I line up a beautiful platter here with a whole lettuce that I bought. There, Those are the, and I can leave the thing or cut them in half like this.\n\nDoesn't really matter. And my chicken, I'm going to cut it with the, with this here. Makes it easy. And in my house, we serve the whole chicken, that includes the bone, backbone and all that. In fact, we can have whole fight to eat the bone, pieces with the bone on it.\n\nSo this is the type of things, of course, you have to eat with friends. You have to eat with friends because you have to eat with your finger. The wing. Okay, here it is here. Something on the other side.\n\nSo as you can see, I do about 8, 10 piece of chicken that I cut. Okay, Now remember, this is about cooked enough now. There is always the juice here left in the pan. So don't throw that out. Mix it with that.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit of lime juice here on my salad and on the chicken as well. Don't forget to put a bit of salt, especially on the outside on the salad as you want to eat that salad, of course. Pepper. And that's, this is so lukewarm this way, of course. And I have that on top.\n\nSo you know, I put mushroom in there, I put shallot because I have that in my refrigerator. Look at what you have in your refrigerator. Remember that what you are doing, you are doing the chicken your own. You are making it your own. This.\n\nOkay. I have some herb on top even. Dash of olive oil on the outside on my salad. That's about it. Oh, here I have a beautiful tomato from the garden.\n\nMight as well use it. Yeah, a yellow tomato from my garden. Yeah. You don't have to do it, or you can put a red tomato or nothing at all. It's fine.\n\nBit of bit of color, taste. Think in terms of color, but more think in terms of taste. It's good if it look good, but it should taste good first. And this is about it. My rotisserie chicken transformed my own way to bring to my friend for dinner.\n\nHappy cooking.", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home.", "start":

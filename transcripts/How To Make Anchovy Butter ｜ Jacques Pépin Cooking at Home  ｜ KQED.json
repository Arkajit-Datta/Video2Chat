You know, professional chefs very often use what we call compound butter. Butter mixed with a certain sauce and you can have it in your refrigerator, even in your freezer. Because the classic 1 is a maitre d' butter, which is parsley, butter, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and so forth. And then you do what with a reduction of meat. And here I'm going to show it to you with anchovy butter. And I have here half a stick of butter and a good tablespoon of anchovy paste. To this I'm going to put a little bit of parsley here. Maybe a tablespoon or 2. Maybe a tablespoon or 2. About a teaspoon of lemon juice. A good teaspoon of lemon juice. A dash of salt. Remember this is unsalted butter. And cracked pepper. This is very good on top of fish, on top of meat, on top of poultry, on top of something grilled and all that, even on top of vegetable. So keep that in mind. We are going to mix it here. When I was an apprentice, we used to have 5 or 6 different types of compound butter like that, which was used, fish as well as meat. So mix it well. Of course, very often we do large quantity of this. And what you do with that conventionally, you know, you put it into a piece of Saran wrap like this. That's it. Yeah. You can mold this to the size you want. Yeah. Okay. And that's it. You keep that in your refrigerator for a week, but you can put it in the freezer too and even cut a piece frozen what you need.

You know, professional chefs very often use what we call compound butter. Butter mixed with a certain sauce and you can have it in your refrigerator, even in your freezer. Because the classic 1 is a maitre d' butter, which is parsley, butter, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and so forth. And then you do what with a reduction of meat.\n\nAnd here I'm going to show it to you with anchovy butter. And I have here half a stick of butter and a good tablespoon of anchovy paste. To this I'm going to put a little bit of parsley here. Maybe a tablespoon or 2. Maybe a tablespoon or 2.\n\nAbout a teaspoon of lemon juice. A good teaspoon of lemon juice. A dash of salt. Remember this is unsalted butter. And cracked pepper.\n\nThis is very good on top of fish, on top of meat, on top of poultry, on top of something grilled and all that, even on top of vegetable. So keep that in mind. We are going to mix it here. When I was an apprentice, we used to have 5 or 6 different types of compound butter like that, which was used, fish as well as meat. So mix it well.\n\nOf course, very often we do large quantity of this. And what you do with that conventionally, you know, you put it into a piece of Saran wrap like this. That's it. Yeah. You can mold this to the size you want.\n\nYeah. Okay. And that's it. You keep that in your refrigerator for a week, but you can put it in the freezer too and even cut a piece frozen what you need.

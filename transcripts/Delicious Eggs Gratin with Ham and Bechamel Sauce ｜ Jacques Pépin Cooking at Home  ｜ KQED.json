When I don't know what to do for dinner, I very often end up with eggs. I want to show you there, a gratin of eggs, how to do it with a little bechamel, a cream sauce. So here, I need about a tablespoon, tablespoon of butter in there, and a tablespoon of flour. So this is what you call your roux. You know, when you add the flour and butter together. Usually, you mix it. And here I cook it, what, 10, 15 seconds, 20, 30 seconds. That's it. And then a cup of milk. The milk is cold, as you can see. Dash of salt in there. Dash of pepper. And you want to bring that to a boil. That's a cream sauce. Occasionally, you mix with your whisk. Make sure that you put the palm of your hand on top of it here to go into those corners here. As soon as it comes to a boil, it's going to thicken. So at that point, what we have here, I have eggs here. As you can see, that I slice. And those eggs are perfectly cooked, totally yellow, no green around the yolk. And this is what you don't want. I have 5 eggs here. For 2 people, it would be a nice gratin. And I wanted to show you how to peel an egg. When that egg is lower into boiling water, 9, 10 minutes at the most. After that it's cooked, Take it out, pour out the boiling water, and put ice or cold water. Leave it in cold water until it's cold enough. This is important. This is what prevent that green tinge around the yolk, because that green tinge is caused by that, by the sulfur in the eggs. See, I break it all around there. And of course here, if I were in the sink, I would do that under running water to peel it. You see, because there is a second skin here, and when the water run, it run in between that skin and makes it easy to peel. So here, water. Okay. Here's my eggs. I have 5 eggs. I can, any type of garnish that I want to put on top. Let's do that. That will come to a boil pretty good. So what I want to do, I have mushroom here. I am going to garnish. That actually, 1 mushroom. I think maybe enough. I'll put it in my sauce to bring it to a boil. Now it's boiling, as you can see here. And now I will put a little bit of cream in there, probably a quarter of a cup or so. And that's it. That's my cream sauce. Very rich and delicious. So in the garnish of this, in that case here, I'm putting a few corn, because I happen to have corn here. I'm putting about a third of a cup of mozzarella cheese. You could put Swiss cheese. You could put this. And I have a little bit of ham here. 2 small slice of ham. I put also the garnish on top. I'm going to put some cracked paper on top of that. I think I'll need it more. I can do that ahead. If you do it ahead, you want to cook it in the oven, a regular oven, 400 degrees, probably 20 minutes. If it's boiling hot when I put that on top, then I can do it under the broiler. Some chives. And of course, you can do the same idea with a gratin of cauliflower, a gratin of a different type of vegetables. So here, Move it a little bit to have some of the sauce going in between. Here we are here. Maybe a teaspoon or so of Parmesan cheese on top of it. There you go. And that's it. Now we're gonna put that under the broiler for a few minutes. Of course, you can prepare that ahead and put it in when you're ready. Here is my gratin of eggs. Now 3 minutes under the broiler makes a delightful dinner or a lunch. Nothing like eggs. Making a mess with the cheese. Really good. Okay. The cheese. Really good. Okay. Here is our gratin of eggs with bechamel, a little cream sauce, and a little bit of ham in it and corn.

When I don't know what to do for dinner, I very often end up with eggs. I want to show you there, a gratin of eggs, how to do it with a little bechamel, a cream sauce. So here, I need about a tablespoon, tablespoon of butter in there, and a tablespoon of flour. So this is what you call your roux.\n\nYou know, when you add the flour and butter together. Usually, you mix it. And here I cook it, what, 10, 15 seconds, 20, 30 seconds. That's it. And then a cup of milk.\n\nThe milk is cold, as you can see. Dash of salt in there. Dash of pepper. And you want to bring that to a boil. That's a cream sauce.\n\nOccasionally, you mix with your whisk. Make sure that you put the palm of your hand on top of it here to go into those corners here. As soon as it comes to a boil, it's going to thicken. So at that point, what we have here, I have eggs here. As you can see, that I slice.\n\nAnd those eggs are perfectly cooked, totally yellow, no green around the yolk. And this is what you don't want. I have 5 eggs here. For 2 people, it would be a nice gratin. And I wanted to show you how to peel an egg.\n\nWhen that egg is lower into boiling water, 9, 10 minutes at the most. After that it's cooked, Take it out, pour out the boiling water, and put ice or cold water. Leave it in cold water until it's cold enough. This is important. This is what prevent that green tinge around the yolk, because that green tinge is caused by that, by the sulfur in the eggs.\n\nSee, I break it all around there. And of course here, if I were in the sink, I would do that under running water to peel it. You see, because there is a second skin here, and when the water run, it run in between that skin and makes it easy to peel. So here, water. Okay.\n\nHere's my eggs. I have 5 eggs. I can, any type of garnish that I want to put on top. Let's do that. That will come to a boil pretty good.\n\nSo what I want to do, I have mushroom here. I am going to garnish. That actually, 1 mushroom. I think maybe enough. I'll put it in my sauce to bring it to a boil.\n\nNow it's boiling, as you can see here. And now I will put a little bit of cream in there, probably a quarter of a cup or so. And that's it. That's my cream sauce. Very rich and delicious.\n\nSo in the garnish of this, in that case here, I'm putting a few corn, because I happen to have corn here. I'm putting about a third of a cup of mozzarella cheese. You could put Swiss cheese. You could put this. And I have a little bit of ham here.\n\n2 small slice of ham. I put also the garnish on top. I'm going to put some cracked paper on top of that. I think I'll need it more. I can do that ahead.\n\nIf you do it ahead, you want to cook it in the oven, a regular oven, 400 degrees, probably 20 minutes. If it's boiling hot when I put that on top, then I can do it under the broiler. Some chives. And of course, you can do the same idea with a gratin of cauliflower, a gratin of a different type of vegetables. So here, Move it a little bit to have some of the sauce going in between.\n\nHere we are here. Maybe a teaspoon or so of Parmesan cheese on top of it. There you go. And that's it. Now we're gonna put that under the broiler for a few minutes.\n\nOf course, you can prepare that ahead and put it in when you're ready. Here is my gratin of eggs. Now 3 minutes under the broiler makes a delightful dinner or a lunch. Nothing like eggs. Making a mess with the cheese.\n\nReally good. Okay. The cheese. Really good. Okay.\n\nHere is our gratin of eggs with bechamel, a little cream sauce, and a little bit of ham in it and corn.

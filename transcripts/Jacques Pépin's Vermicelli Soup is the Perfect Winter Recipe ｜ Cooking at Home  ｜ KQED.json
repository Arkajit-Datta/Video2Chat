You know, soup for me is often dinner, but 1 of the most visceral soup. I mean, you know that I always have it in my mind, in my heart, is the soup my mother used to do, called soup au vermicelli. What we call vermicelli in France is those tiny egg noodle. Sometimes they come in a bottle, too, vermicelli in Italian. And always with stock, do this, a couple of leeks, scallion, that was it. Claudine, my daughter, is hooked on that, and as well as my granddaughter. So I have often my own stock, like I have here, but this is very, Very, very weak. There is no salt in it. So often to strengthen it, I put a little bit of that base, that chicken base here. And this 1 is an organic 1, so it's good to have. Or regular, I can buy chicken stock also, that you can buy 1 or the other. Oh, well, then I'll put a bit of salt in there because as I said, it's 1 of the, in seasoning I have about 6 cup of stock here. I usually put, I went through my refrigerator here and I see those old scallion. No cut the end of it, trim them. I always have scallion in my refrigerator, all leek. Okay, here. Okay. And I have a few chives there because I have them in my garden now and I like chives. So I'm going to put some pepper in there. I'm going to chop this. To put it in there. Sometime, you know, instead of the vermicelli here, the pasta, I put instant mashed potato. Very good, very fast. Or very often also kind of leftover rice. Often we have rice, or sometimes I go to the Chinese restaurant and they have rice and I take what's left. And, and that's it. This, Other time it boiled a couple of minutes. I put my vermicelli inside as well. And here I have about a cup of it. Should about 2 ounces. You could do it thicker or not as thick or whatever. Let it bring back to a boil and, well, Boil like 4 or 5 minutes at the most and it's ready. This, I'll put that in there in a little while. Okay. The chives. So sometimes for lunch, when I don't know what to do for lunch, I have that and my wife is happy with that. I always like to put a little bit of cheese in it. For me, my favorite 1 is Swiss cheese. And this is, you know, Jarlsberg or Emmentaler or, you know, Gruyere and any of this, it's fine. So this is it. Wait another 3, 4 minutes and we can serve it with the cheese. That's it, the soup is cooked and a little bit of gruyere in the bottom or no cheese at all. Okay, here is it. We have good for 2 or 3 here. So that's it here. With the gruyere at the end, you know. I'm going to taste it. Just like my mother used to be.

You know, soup for me is often dinner, but 1 of the most visceral soup. I mean, you know that I always have it in my mind, in my heart, is the soup my mother used to do, called soup au vermicelli. What we call vermicelli in France is those tiny egg noodle. Sometimes they come in a bottle, too, vermicelli in Italian.\n\nAnd always with stock, do this, a couple of leeks, scallion, that was it. Claudine, my daughter, is hooked on that, and as well as my granddaughter. So I have often my own stock, like I have here, but this is very, Very, very weak. There is no salt in it. So often to strengthen it, I put a little bit of that base, that chicken base here.\n\nAnd this 1 is an organic 1, so it's good to have. Or regular, I can buy chicken stock also, that you can buy 1 or the other. Oh, well, then I'll put a bit of salt in there because as I said, it's 1 of the, in seasoning I have about 6 cup of stock here. I usually put, I went through my refrigerator here and I see those old scallion. No cut the end of it, trim them.\n\nI always have scallion in my refrigerator, all leek. Okay, here. Okay. And I have a few chives there because I have them in my garden now and I like chives. So I'm going to put some pepper in there.\n\nI'm going to chop this. To put it in there. Sometime, you know, instead of the vermicelli here, the pasta, I put instant mashed potato. Very good, very fast. Or very often also kind of leftover rice.\n\nOften we have rice, or sometimes I go to the Chinese restaurant and they have rice and I take what's left. And, and that's it. This, Other time it boiled a couple of minutes. I put my vermicelli inside as well. And here I have about a cup of it.\n\nShould about 2 ounces. You could do it thicker or not as thick or whatever. Let it bring back to a boil and, well, Boil like 4 or 5 minutes at the most and it's ready. This, I'll put that in there in a little while. Okay.\n\nThe chives. So sometimes for lunch, when I don't know what to do for lunch, I have that and my wife is happy with that. I always like to put a little bit of cheese in it. For me, my favorite 1 is Swiss cheese. And this is, you know, Jarlsberg or Emmentaler or, you know, Gruyere and any of this, it's fine.\n\nSo this is it. Wait another 3, 4 minutes and we can serve it with the cheese. That's it, the soup is cooked and a little bit of gruyere in the bottom or no cheese at all. Okay, here is it. We have good for 2 or 3 here.\n\nSo that's it here. With the gruyere at the end, you know. I'm going to taste it. Just like my mother used to be.

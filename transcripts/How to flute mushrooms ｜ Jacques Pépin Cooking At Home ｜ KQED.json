When I was an apprentice many, many years ago, 1 of the things that we had to learn was how to flute a mushroom, turn a mushroom or flute a mushroom. It takes a lot of practice to do that, and it's not that particularly useful. But I want to show you how to do it. You use your thumb as a pivot, like this. Sometimes people take it here and use this as a pivot. 1 or the other, I tend to do that. You put it there. You go to the center and do like this you know you turn all around The mushroom should be very firm, of course, to do that. And then when you finish here, you clean up, of course, your mushroom. To have that kind of spiral mushroom that you do, which as I say, requests a lot of practice and it's basically useless. Well, I'll show you another way, another decoration, which is much easier to do. And you use only a little bit of the mushroom. You take a large mushroom like that and you cut the top. Now this becomes a canvas and you draw something. Sometimes I draw a chicken too. In that case here, I'm going to draw a fish. So I draw a fish out of it here. Okay, here is my fish. I'm going to mark the fish. And then after you mark the fish you cut around to create a relief to create a relief like this so that the fish stand out on top. Then when you have the fish standing out, you trim the outside. And ultimately you cut a little slice of this where you have your decoration on top. So meaning you don't use almost none of your mushroom, only that little piece. We then Put a bit of lemon juice on top so it doesn't discolor. And you have a nice decoration to put on top of a broiled fish or a mushroom soup or something like that. I hope you enjoy it. Happy cooking. \u266a\u266a\u266a Thank you.

When I was an apprentice many, many years ago, 1 of the things that we had to learn was how to flute a mushroom, turn a mushroom or flute a mushroom. It takes a lot of practice to do that, and it's not that particularly useful. But I want to show you how to do it. You use your thumb as a pivot, like this.\n\nSometimes people take it here and use this as a pivot. 1 or the other, I tend to do that. You put it there. You go to the center and do like this you know you turn all around The mushroom should be very firm, of course, to do that. And then when you finish here, you clean up, of course, your mushroom.\n\nTo have that kind of spiral mushroom that you do, which as I say, requests a lot of practice and it's basically useless. Well, I'll show you another way, another decoration, which is much easier to do. And you use only a little bit of the mushroom. You take a large mushroom like that and you cut the top. Now this becomes a canvas and you draw something.\n\nSometimes I draw a chicken too. In that case here, I'm going to draw a fish. So I draw a fish out of it here. Okay, here is my fish. I'm going to mark the fish.\n\nAnd then after you mark the fish you cut around to create a relief to create a relief like this so that the fish stand out on top. Then when you have the fish standing out, you trim the outside. And ultimately you cut a little slice of this where you have your decoration on top. So meaning you don't use almost none of your mushroom, only that little piece. We then Put a bit of lemon juice on top so it doesn't discolor.\n\nAnd you have a nice decoration to put on top of a broiled fish or a mushroom soup or something like that. I hope you enjoy it. Happy cooking. \u266a\u266a\u266a Thank you.

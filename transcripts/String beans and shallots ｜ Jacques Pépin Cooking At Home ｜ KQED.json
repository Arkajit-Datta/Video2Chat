I want to show you how to cook string beans, haricots verts in France. We refer usually to the haricots verts to the very tiny 1. Those are OK. They could be finer than that for the haricot vert. When I was a kid, you had to take the haricot vert here. And this is the end, which is hanging through the plant. We would cut this 1 and that 1. Like the end, the long 1 here, you would cut it this way and run it, and you would have a string right up. We get to the end, we break it on the other side, and you'd have another string on the other side. String means don't have any string anymore. You still have to remove at least that piece. By habit, I still remove the other piece as well. But in any case, I remember years ago, we cooked that a long time. Then we cooked it less and less and less to the point that now people call blanched it. That is, put it in boiling water for a few seconds, remove it. That's not enough for me. So water, a good amount of salt in the water. Put your string beans. We used to do that in large baths in professional kitchens which were in copper. And the copper itself tend to keep them green. But of course, it's not done anymore. I have enough water here. Theoretically, also, you're told not to cover it. But I cover it. And the only reason is that it comes back faster to a boil, otherwise it takes too long. Coming back to a boil, and we will boil it for a few minutes and taste it. For the time being, that string beans is raw, as you can see. And if I go like this, it breaks. Textures change as it goes along. We're going to saute that with some shallots. I have the shallots here. Shallots, of course, is a type of onion. And you peel it on each side. It's classic to have the string beans saut\u00e9 with shallot, of course. But first, you cook your string beans. You cool your string beans. You cool your string beans. And when you're ready, you start saut\u00e9ing it. So here, I have a shallot which is cut in half. To cut that shallot, again, I will use my finger. Notice that I put them flat, so it's easier when it's round. And here I would go this way. Good. So this is all cut here, as you can see, but still attached to the end. So I go on the side here, cut a little bit this way. Again, this way, maybe twice. And again, the same idea here. This is finely chopped shallot. Which you. Finely chopped shallot. Finely sliced shallot. So here, this is usually the 2 ways those shallots are used. Sometimes whole also. You have the chopped shallot, sliced shallot. And for the string beans, you can use 1 or the other. Now, as you can see, it's boiling. So you can uncover it if you want. It's about 2 minutes now, and a lot of people would remove it at that point. And at that point, yeah, it's bad. But for me, no. It depends also, of course, on the size of your haricots verts. Your string beans sometimes are very, very thin, very fresh out of the garden. All of that changes. But we're at 3 minutes now. And for me, I will need, with that size string beans, at least another couple of minutes. I don't like them mushy. I like them slightly firm, crunchy on their own, but with the taste of string beans. When they are undercooked like that, to me, they don't really have the taste of string beans. Another thing, too, as we used to do a very large quantity of it, as soon as they are cooked, we would transfer them to ice water. That stops the cooking. And it's fine. Especially in a professional kitchen, when you do 345 pounds at a time. I have half a pound of string beans here. And at home, what I would do, I would drain the water out and keep them here so that they dry out. Because of the hotness, they dry out very easily. And then right away, I take a skillet, a little bit of butter, and I saute them in there. So I think my string meats now are about 6 minutes. If I see the small 1 here, the small 1 is perfect now. Just slightly crunchy. So at that point here, I would put them under cold water. Of course, I'll cool them up, but just to show it to you. I could actually continue cooking in there if I need it right away, it would be fine. But if I don't need right away, I may refresh them a little bit so that and then leave them here ready to be saut\u00e9ed. And as you can see, they are beautifully green. To saute the string beans, I will use a skillet, like a tablespoon of butter. And always, I put a little dash of oil. That prevents the butter from burning also. You want to saute that. For different taste in your spring beans, you could let the butter cook enough so it becomes slightly azerlot in color, slightly brown. It will have a different taste. I have the chopped shallots here. And actually, I'm going to put a bit of the sliced shallot, too. So this, remember the shallot are raw. This is cooked. So let that cook for 30, 40 seconds on high heat. So even though I add salt in the water, we still need a little bit of salt here. So here it goes. This is cooked enough now. And put that in there. And of course, mine are still hot, but otherwise I would let them. That's your salt, salt and pepper. All right. This is a classic garnish for a rack of lamb or a steak. And here we are, spring beet with shallots. Mix with shallots. Harikover or ze shalot. Mmm, perfectly cooked. Mmm, perfect secret.", "confidence": 0.82036334, "words": [{"word": "hi", "start": 4.3399997, "end": 4.8399997, "confidence": 0.9890382, "punctuated_word": "Hi,"}, {"word": "i'm", "start": 4.8599997,

I want to show you how to cook string beans, haricots verts in France. We refer usually to the haricots verts to the very tiny 1. Those are OK. They could be finer than that for the haricot vert.\n\nWhen I was a kid, you had to take the haricot vert here. And this is the end, which is hanging through the plant. We would cut this 1 and that 1. Like the end, the long 1 here, you would cut it this way and run it, and you would have a string right up. We get to the end, we break it on the other side, and you'd have another string on the other side.\n\nString means don't have any string anymore. You still have to remove at least that piece. By habit, I still remove the other piece as well. But in any case, I remember years ago, we cooked that a long time. Then we cooked it less and less and less to the point that now people call blanched it.\n\nThat is, put it in boiling water for a few seconds, remove it. That's not enough for me. So water, a good amount of salt in the water. Put your string beans. We used to do that in large baths in professional kitchens which were in copper.\n\nAnd the copper itself tend to keep them green. But of course, it's not done anymore. I have enough water here. Theoretically, also, you're told not to cover it. But I cover it.\n\nAnd the only reason is that it comes back faster to a boil, otherwise it takes too long. Coming back to a boil, and we will boil it for a few minutes and taste it. For the time being, that string beans is raw, as you can see. And if I go like this, it breaks. Textures change as it goes along.\n\nWe're going to saute that with some shallots. I have the shallots here. Shallots, of course, is a type of onion. And you peel it on each side. It's classic to have the string beans saut\u00e9 with shallot, of course.\n\nBut first, you cook your string beans. You cool your string beans. You cool your string beans. And when you're ready, you start saut\u00e9ing it. So here, I have a shallot which is cut in half.\n\nTo cut that shallot, again, I will use my finger. Notice that I put them flat, so it's easier when it's round. And here I would go this way. Good. So this is all cut here, as you can see, but still attached to the end.\n\nSo I go on the side here, cut a little bit this way. Again, this way, maybe twice. And again, the same idea here. This is finely chopped shallot. Which you.\n\nFinely chopped shallot. Finely sliced shallot. So here, this is usually the 2 ways those shallots are used. Sometimes whole also. You have the chopped shallot, sliced shallot.\n\nAnd for the string beans, you can use 1 or the other. Now, as you can see, it's boiling. So you can uncover it if you want. It's about 2 minutes now, and a lot of people would remove it at that point. And at that point, yeah, it's bad.\n\nBut for me, no. It depends also, of course, on the size of your haricots verts. Your string beans sometimes are very, very thin, very fresh out of the garden. All of that changes. But we're at 3 minutes now.\n\nAnd for me, I will need, with that size string beans, at least another couple of minutes. I don't like them mushy. I like them slightly firm, crunchy on their own, but with the taste of string beans. When they are undercooked like that, to me, they don't really have the taste of string beans. Another thing, too, as we used to do a very large quantity of it, as soon as they are cooked, we would transfer them to ice water.\n\nThat stops the cooking. And it's fine. Especially in a professional kitchen, when you do 345 pounds at a time. I have half a pound of string beans here. And at home, what I would do, I would drain the water out and keep them here so that they dry out.\n\nBecause of the hotness, they dry out very easily. And then right away, I take a skillet, a little bit of butter, and I saute them in there. So I think my string meats now are about 6 minutes. If I see the small 1 here, the small 1 is perfect now. Just slightly crunchy.\n\nSo at that point here, I would put them under cold water. Of course, I'll cool them up, but just to show it to you. I could actually continue cooking in there if I need it right away, it would be fine. But if I don't need right away, I may refresh them a little bit so that and then leave them here ready to be saut\u00e9ed. And as you can see, they are beautifully green.\n\nTo saute the string beans, I will use a skillet, like a tablespoon of butter. And always, I put a little dash of oil. That prevents the butter from burning also. You want to saute that. For different taste in your spring beans, you could let the butter cook enough so it becomes slightly azerlot in color, slightly brown.\n\nIt will have a different taste. I have the chopped shallots here. And actually, I'm going to put a bit of the sliced shallot, too. So this, remember the shallot are raw. This is cooked.\n\nSo let that cook for 30, 40 seconds on high heat. So even though I add salt in the water, we still need a little bit of salt here. So here it goes. This is cooked enough now. And put that in there.\n\nAnd of course, mine are still hot, but otherwise I would let them. That's your salt, salt and pepper. All right. This is a classic garnish for a rack of lamb or a steak. And here we are, spring beet with shallots.\n\nMix with shallots. Harikover or ze shalot. Mmm, perfectly cooked. Mmm, perfect secret.", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home.", "start": 4.3399997, "end": 7.54}, {"text": "I want to show you how to cook string

I want to show you how to make my shrimp cocktail. Very often, the shrimp are just poached in water, and that's when I want to do it a bit differently. Those are large shrimp, as you can see. Those are about 15 count. I kind of press on the tail like this to pull it out, because sometimes I want to have the tail itself coming like this. So those are, I have half a pound of shrimp here. Now you can see, and the first thing that I do, I'm gonna put a good dash of pepper flake, 1 cup of water, a little dash of herb de Provence or Italian seasoning. Maybe 1, maybe 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and maybe a couple of tablespoons of onion in there. Yeah, so any old way doesn't really matter. What I want to do now is to bring that to a boil. I boiled it for like 5 minutes, you know. So I really have taste in this. So now, the sauce usually, a couple of tablespoon of, maybe 2, 3 tablespoon of ketchup, a good teaspoon maybe of shirisha. Yeah, maybe a good teaspoon more of, of radish and a little dash of rice vinegar, maybe a teaspoon. I do different type of sauce for that, but that's 1 of the sauce that I do for shrimp cocktail or for my clam. Okay, so the shrimp shell that I've been cooking, I'm quite potent, strong, So I will push it. All I need is basically the liquid here. That's it. I'll put my liquid back in there. And the shrimp. All I do now, I bring it to a boil. As soon as it come to a boil, I shut it off, put it on the side to cool off. Okay, now my shrimp are cold. They've been staying in that liquid too. So I will put a bit of that really flavorful liquid to put here, there, and like 4 shrimp per person. We're gonna put 4 shrimp per person here. This way, This way. Those are large shrimp, of course. Whoop. The thick side inside, rather. Right. Can bring that here. You can put a little piece of basil or something if you want in the center for presentation. And this is our shrimp cocktail.

I want to show you how to make my shrimp cocktail. Very often, the shrimp are just poached in water, and that's when I want to do it a bit differently. Those are large shrimp, as you can see. Those are about 15 count.\n\nI kind of press on the tail like this to pull it out, because sometimes I want to have the tail itself coming like this. So those are, I have half a pound of shrimp here. Now you can see, and the first thing that I do, I'm gonna put a good dash of pepper flake, 1 cup of water, a little dash of herb de Provence or Italian seasoning. Maybe 1, maybe 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and maybe a couple of tablespoons of onion in there. Yeah, so any old way doesn't really matter.\n\nWhat I want to do now is to bring that to a boil. I boiled it for like 5 minutes, you know. So I really have taste in this. So now, the sauce usually, a couple of tablespoon of, maybe 2, 3 tablespoon of ketchup, a good teaspoon maybe of shirisha. Yeah, maybe a good teaspoon more of, of radish and a little dash of rice vinegar, maybe a teaspoon.\n\nI do different type of sauce for that, but that's 1 of the sauce that I do for shrimp cocktail or for my clam. Okay, so the shrimp shell that I've been cooking, I'm quite potent, strong, So I will push it. All I need is basically the liquid here. That's it. I'll put my liquid back in there.\n\nAnd the shrimp. All I do now, I bring it to a boil. As soon as it come to a boil, I shut it off, put it on the side to cool off. Okay, now my shrimp are cold. They've been staying in that liquid too.\n\nSo I will put a bit of that really flavorful liquid to put here, there, and like 4 shrimp per person. We're gonna put 4 shrimp per person here. This way, This way. Those are large shrimp, of course. Whoop.\n\nThe thick side inside, rather. Right. Can bring that here. You can put a little piece of basil or something if you want in the center for presentation.

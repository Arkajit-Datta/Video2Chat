Today I want to show you how to make a very easy, delicious dish, very, very inexpensive. We call it in France a poteau feu, that is a boiling of usually beef, beef shank, sometimes with chicken, sometimes with turkey. I'm doing it here with turkey neck. Those are large turkey neck that I can get at my market, but you can do it, of course, with chicken neck, chicken gizzard, chicken carcass, just the bone of the chicken, or the turkey. I do it with all of this. And we start by putting that. I have 2 pound of bone here. It's for like 2, 3 people. You have to eat that with your hand. Of course, I have 3 quarts of water there, 3 quarts of water, thyme and bay leaf. That's it. Dash of salt in there. OK. And then we bring that to a boil. And now my turkey neck bone here. I've been cooking for 45 minutes. And as I said, you can do that with the carcass, with the gizzard, and all that. It's cooked. It's about cooked now. You can see a lot of water in it because we're doing that p\u00e2te au feu. So I will lick. Celery, turnips, white turnips, 1 onion, 3 carrots. You can see a couple of potato. And 4 little wedge of cabbage, you know. Either Savoy cabbage or this 1 doesn't really matter. Okay. This will come back to a boil and cook a good 30 minutes. And this is it. The whole boiled dinner. Usually we would serve that putting the whole thing directly on a large platter like this. With this, of course, I do a great soup the day after, or whatever is leftover. Whatever is leftover is cut into pieces, mixed with the vegetable, and all that. So that, we would really usually bring that to the table this way. Maybe 1 carrot, a piece of cabbage, a couple of the beautiful neck here, a couple of the, a little piece of, I don't need that. This is a piece of celery. Piece of celery. Oh, a little piece of the turnips. This well cooked now. Piece of potato and that's it. You would serve this with a little bit of bouillon on top, Like that at the table, but mostly on the side, you would serve a bowl of soup. And in that bowl of soup, when you're ready, some croutons, some cheese. Make sure you use your finger to suck the flesh out of those bones. Absolutely delicious. You will enjoy it. Happy cooking. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You.

Jacques Pepin and I'm cooking at home. Today I want to show you how to make a very easy, delicious dish, very, very inexpensive. We call it in France a poteau feu, that is a boiling of usually beef, beef shank, sometimes with chicken, sometimes with turkey. I'm doing it here with turkey neck. Those are large turkey neck that I can get at my market, but you can do it, of course, with chicken neck, chicken gizzard, chicken carcass, just the bone of the chicken, or the turkey.\n\nI do it with all of this. And we start by putting that. I have 2 pound of bone here. It's for like 2, 3 people. You have to eat that with your hand.\n\nOf course, I have 3 quarts of water there, 3 quarts of water, thyme and bay leaf. That's it. Dash of salt in there. OK. And then we bring that to a boil.\n\nAnd now my turkey neck bone here. I've been cooking for 45 minutes. And as I said, you can do that with the carcass, with the gizzard, and all that. It's cooked. It's about cooked now.\n\nYou can see a lot of water in it because we're doing that p\u00e2te au feu. So I will lick. Celery, turnips, white turnips, 1 onion, 3 carrots. You can see a couple of potato. And 4 little wedge of cabbage, you know.\n\nEither Savoy cabbage or this 1 doesn't really matter. Okay. This will come back to a boil and cook a good 30 minutes. And this is it. The whole boiled dinner.\n\nUsually we would serve that putting the whole thing directly on a large platter like this. With this, of course, I do a great soup the day after, or whatever is leftover. Whatever is leftover is cut into pieces, mixed with the vegetable, and all that. So that, we would really usually bring that to the table this way. Maybe 1 carrot, a piece of cabbage, a couple of the beautiful neck here, a couple of the, a little piece of, I don't need that.\n\nThis is a piece of celery. Piece of celery. Oh, a little piece of the turnips. This well cooked now. Piece of potato and that's it.\n\nYou would serve this with a little bit of bouillon on top, Like that at the table, but mostly on the side, you would serve a bowl of soup. And in that bowl of soup, when you're ready, some croutons, some cheese. Make sure you use your finger to suck the flesh out of those bones. Absolutely delicious. You will enjoy it.\n\nHappy cooking. You. You. You. You.\n\nYou. You. You. You. You.\n\nYou. You. You. You. You.\n\nYou. You. You. You. You.\n\nYou.", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin and I'm cooking at home.", "start": 4.4, "end": 7.58}, {"text": "Today I want to show you how to make a very easy,
